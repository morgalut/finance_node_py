How about building an **AI-Powered Personal Finance Dashboard**? Here’s a breakdown of how you could structure the project:

### Project Overview
Create a web application that helps users manage their personal finances with AI-driven insights and recommendations. The dashboard will provide users with financial summaries, spending analysis, and predictive insights using AI and data analysis.

### Components

#### Backend (Node.js + Python)
1. **Node.js Server**: 
   - **API Endpoints**: Set up RESTful APIs to handle user data, financial transactions, and AI predictions.
   - **User Authentication**: Implement user login and registration.

2. **Python (AI & Data Analysis)**:
   - **Financial Data Processing**: Use NumPy and pandas for analyzing transaction data and generating insights.
   - **AI Model**: Build and train a model to predict future spending patterns, identify savings opportunities, and provide financial advice.

#### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
1. **Dashboard**:
   - **Financial Summary**: Display an overview of the user’s financial status, including income, expenses, and savings.
   - **Spending Categories**: Show detailed breakdowns of spending by category with visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs.
   - **AI Insights**: Present predictions and recommendations from the AI model.

2. **React Navigation**:
   - **Routing**: Use React Router or a similar library to navigate between different sections of the application.
   - **Hooks**: Implement React Hooks to manage state and side effects, such as fetching data from the backend and handling user interactions.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and securely log in to their dashboards.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can input and categorize their financial transactions.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use the AI model to forecast future spending and offer actionable insights.
- **Visualization**: Incorporate charts and graphs to help users visualize their financial data.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI**: Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (or another machine learning library)
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, React Router
- **Database**: MongoDB (or another database of your choice for storing user data and transactions)

### Workflow
1. **Set Up Backend**:
   - Develop the Node.js server and set up API endpoints.
   - Create Python scripts for data processing and AI modeling.
   - Integrate Python with Node.js (using something like `child_process` or an HTTP interface).

2. **Develop Frontend**:
   - Build the React components for the dashboard.
   - Implement routing and hooks to manage state and side effects.
   - Connect the frontend with backend APIs to fetch and display data.

3. **Test and Deploy**:
   - Test the entire application to ensure data flows correctly between the backend, AI model, and frontend.
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform or a server of your choice.

This project will give you hands-on experience with integrating AI models into a web application, managing both frontend and backend development, and working with modern tools and technologies.
